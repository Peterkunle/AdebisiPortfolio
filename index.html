        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
          <p>
            I'm Peter Adebisi, a dedicated and detail-oriented professional with a strong background in Marketing, alongside experience supporting operations, logistics, and event-related initiatives. I hold a Higher National Diploma (HND) in Business Administration and have contributed to warehouse operations, logistics coordination, team supervision, school-based product distribution, and event branding initiatives, while maintaining high standards of organization and execution in fast-paced environments.
          </p>
          <p>
            With marketing as one of my core focus areas, I support brand visibility, audience engagement, and on-ground activation efforts that align with business objectives. I am skilled in coordinating teams, improving operational workflows, and ensuring tasks are completed safely, accurately, and on schedule. My experience also includes sourcing and negotiating with vendors, coordinating logistics, and engaging artists for events, all with a focus on efficiency, cost effectiveness, and successful delivery.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to my corporate experience in operations, logistics, and marketing, I also run a small business trading musical instruments, phones, and accessories, where I manage sourcing, sales, and customer relations. Known for a strong work ethic, positive attitude, and a results-driven mindset, I consistently contribute to outcomes that strengthen brand presence and support organizational goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm currently transitioning into the tech space, where I'm building strong foundations in digital project management, team coordination, and technology tools at PLP Academy. I'm driven by a desire to lead impactful projects, collaborate with teams, and help bring ideas to life through clear planning and execution. I am eager to grow, learn, and contribute to dynamic organizations that value innovation, structure, and problem-solving.
